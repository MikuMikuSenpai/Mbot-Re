# Mbot - Contribute Document

## Steps to contribute
1. Fork Mbot
2. Make your changes on your local fork
3. Make a pull request
4. Wait for a contributor (mikumikusenpai or acexcy) to merge it into Mbot

## Guidelines
1. Read all the .md's (markdown files)
2. Don't try to merge suspicious code (for example base64 encoded string that translates sending stuff to your own server)
3. BotConfiguration.java should not be changed unless valid reason given.
