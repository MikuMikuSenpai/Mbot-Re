# Mbot - Contribute Document

> [!NOTE]
> Try to use simple / easy-to-understand variable names.

## How to contribute
1. Fork Mbot
2. Make your changes on your fork
3. Make a pull request
4. Wait for a contributor (mikumikusenpai or acexcy) to merge it into Mbot

## Guidelines
1. Read all the .md (markdown files).
2. Don't try to merge suspicious code (for example: base64 encoded string that translates sending stuff to your own server).
3. BotConfiguration.java and Main.java should not be changed unless a valid reason is given.
